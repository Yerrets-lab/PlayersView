Its prosperity is visible in the massive stone docks and fortified walls, but this wealth is entirely built on imperial extraction. The city is divided into three distinct zones: the Imperial Citadel, the bustling Port District, and the impoverished, resentful Old Town.The atmosphere is heavy with resentment. Imperial soldiers patrol rigidly, and citizens often gather in tight groups, whispering about the harsh Trade Tariffs and the Governor's Autocratic Rule. Revolution is not yet open, but the embers are glowing. Location: Built atop the highest bluff, overlooking the entire city and harbor. It is highly fortified.\nThe Governor's Palace: The seat of power, home to <a data-href=\"Governor Valerius\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Governor Valerius</a>(The Iron Fist). He is paranoid, rarely leaves the Citadel, and relies on <a data-href=\"Imperial Army\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Imperial Army</a> to maintain order. He is the ultimate source of the high taxes and is fiercely anti-representation.\nThe Tax Office: All official paperwork, licenses, and trade taxes are processed here. A PC needs a \"Citizen Pass\" (5gp, valid for 30 days) just to conduct business outside of the Port District. <br>The Merchant Guildhall: Where <a data-href=\"Merrick Bramblecart\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Merrick Bramblecart</a> (and likely his contacts) does business. The Guild is currently split: wealthy merchants support the Empire for protection, while smaller traders (like Merrick) resent the exorbitant tariffs.\nThe City Gate (Now the Imperial Checkpoint): Heavily guarded (4 well-equipped Imperial Soldiers at all times). The Trade Tax: Any goods leaving Stormrest toward Fraf are subject to a 25% tariff levied by the Empire.\nContraband: Imperial law is strict. Possession of unlicenced magic items or powerful weapons is grounds for seizure and detainment (DC 14 Save or 1d6 days in Imperial Jail). <br>The \"Unburdened Hand\" Tavern: A notoriously dingy tavern in the slums that serves as the unofficial meeting spot for the burgeoning <a data-href=\"The Restless Hearth\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Restless Hearth</a> Faction (the revolutionaries).

As common citizens of the Empire or travellers seeking fortune, the following is what you would know as you walk the streets of a major hub like Stormrest or prepare for the long road west.The Empire of Brateranth is the dominant political force in the known world, though its grip loosens the further you travel from the coast.\nThe Sanction on Magic: All arcane magic—spells cast by Magic-Users—is strictly illegal unless registered and sanctioned by the Imperial Administration. Magi of the Empire: These robed enforcers, serve as the Empire's \"arcane police\" hunting down \"wild\" or unregistered casters. Taxation and Order: Imperial soldiers, led by officers, are a constant presence, focused on collecting trade tariffs and maintaining a rigid, often brutal, version of \"order\". Unlike arcane magic, the power of the Elemental Gods is a respected and legal part of daily life.\nClerical Administration: Clerics are the sanctioned spiritual leaders of the Empire. They are responsible for maintaining the elemental ley lines—invisible conduits of divine energy that keep the world in balance. Divine vs. Arcane: To a general citizen, the distinction is clear: Clerics are keepers of the natural order, while \"wild\" mages are dangerous threats to it. Most travellers find themselves in the port city of Stormrest, the gateway to the \"New World\".\nThe Gold Rush: Rumors are flying about a massive gold strike in the northern mining camp of Fraf. It is a place of \"mud and raw lumber,\" attracting anyone looking to get rich—and the complications that come with them. Wilderness Dangers: Beyond the boundary stones of the core provinces, the \"Peace of the Empire\" thins. The roads are plagued by bandits, oversized vermin, and the occasional elven hunting party. The Elven Nations: The land to the west of Stormrest technically belongs to the Elven Nations. While the Empire claims the territory and collects taxes, the local Elves often view travelers as trespassers on their ancestral lands.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Empire and the Sanction","level":3,"id":"The_Empire_and_the_Sanction_0"},{"heading":"Faith and the
